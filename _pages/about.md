I'm pursuing a Ph.D in the Computer Science program at Tulane University and working as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof.Rebecca Faust](https://rjfaust.github.io/). Before joining the Tulane, I completed my Master degree at M.S in Software Engineering in University of California, Irvine(UCI) under the supervision of [Prof.Joshua Garcia](https://jgarcia.ics.uci.edu/). I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering specialized in Software Engineering from The Ohio State University (OSU) in 2022.



Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
