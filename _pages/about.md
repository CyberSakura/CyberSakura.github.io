## Bio
I'm pursuing a Ph.D in the Computer Science program at Tulane University and working as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof.Rebecca Faust](https://rjfaust.github.io/). Before joining the Tulane, I completed my Master degree at M.S in Software Engineering in University of California, Irvine(UCI) under the supervision of [Prof.Joshua Garcia](https://jgarcia.ics.uci.edu/) and earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering specialized in Software Engineering from The Ohio State University (OSU) in 2022.

## Research
My primary research interests lie at the intersection of software engineering, static analysis, and data visualization. Currently, my work focuses on exploring the feasibility of visualizing trace data during the debugging process of Python and Jupyter Notebook scripts. Previously, I was mainly working on the Breaking Strong Encapsulation (BSE) issues under the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), and the implementation of leveraging static analysis techniques to detect potential BSE-related issues from the Java source code known as <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt2tf1d64x/qt2tf1d64x.pdf?t=shqqb9">BEAD</a>.
